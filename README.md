# AI-Based Stress and Emergency Detection Using Wearable Sensor Data

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing wearable IoT sensor data using data science and machine learning techniques to detect stress and emergency conditions. The system aims to support continuous and automatic health monitoring without manual intervention.

---

## 🔹 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of data collected from wearable sensors, including:
- Accelerometer (a_x, a_y, a_z)
- Gyroscope (g_x, g_y, g_z)
- Temperature sensors
- Heart rate and physiological signals

The data captures human activity and health-related parameters such as movement, posture, and body temperature.
